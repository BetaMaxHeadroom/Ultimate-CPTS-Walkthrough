# Pivoting Tunneling, and Port Forwarding

During a `red team engagement`, `penetration test`, or an `Active Directory assessment`, we will often find ourselves in a situation where we might have already compromised the required `credentials`, `ssh keys`, `hashes`, or `access tokens` to move onto another host, but there may be no other host directly reachable from our attack host. In such cases, we may need to use a `pivot host` that we have already compromised to find a way to our next target. One of the most important things to do when landing on a host for the first time is to check our `privilege level`, `network connections`, and potential `VPN or other remote access software`. If a host has more than one network adapter, we can likely use it to move to a different network segment. Pivoting is essentially the idea of `moving to other networks through a compromised host to find more targets on different network segments`.

There are many different terms used to describe a compromised host that we can use to `pivot` to a previously unreachable network segment. Some of the most common are:

- `Pivot Host`
- `Proxy`
- `Foothold`
- `Beach Head system`
- `Jump Host`

Pivoting's primary use is to defeat segmentation (both physically and virtually) to access an isolated network. `Tunneling`, on the other hand, is a subset of pivoting. Tunneling encapsulates network traffic into another protocol and routes traffic through it. Think of it like this:

We have a `key` we need to send to a partner, but we do not want anyone who sees our package to know it is a key. So we get a stuffed animal toy and hide the key inside with instructions about what it does. We then package the toy up and send it to our partner. Anyone who inspects the box will see a simple stuffed toy, not realizing it contains something else. Only our partner will know that the key is hidden inside and will learn how to access and use it once delivered.

Typical applications like VPNs or specialized browsers are just another form of tunneling network traffic.

#### Lateral Movement
Lateral movement can be described as a technique used to further our access to additional `hosts`, `applications`, and `services` within a network environment. Lateral movement can also help us gain access to specific domain resources we may need to elevate our privileges. Lateral Movement often enables privilege escalation across hosts.

#### Pivoting
Utilizing multiple hosts to cross `network` boundaries you would not usually have access to. This is more of a targeted objective. The goal here is to allow us to move deeper into a network by compromising targeted hosts or infrastructure.

#### Tunneling
We often find ourselves using various protocols to shuttle traffic in/out of a network where there is a chance of our traffic being detected. For example, using HTTP to mask our Command & Control traffic from a server we own to the victim host. The key here is obfuscation of our actions to avoid detection for as long as possible. We utilize protocols with enhanced security measures such as HTTPS over TLS or SSH over other transport protocols. These types of actions also enable tactics like the exfiltration of data out of a target network or the delivery of more payloads and instructions into the network.

### Port Forwarding
`Port forwarding` is a technique that allows us to redirect a communication request from one port to another. Port forwarding uses TCP as the primary communication layer to provide interactive communication for the forwarded port. However, different application layer protocols such as SSH or even [SOCKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS) (non-application layer) can be used to encapsulate the forwarded traffic. This can be effective in bypassing firewalls and using existing services on your compromised host to pivot to other networks.
#### SSH  Local Port Forwarding
![](https://i.imgur.com/Afgxlom.png)

We have our attack host (10.10.15.x) and a target Ubuntu server (10.129.x.x), which we have compromised. We will scan the target Ubuntu server using Nmap to search for open ports.
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sT -p22,3306 10.129.202.64

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-24 12:12 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.202.64
Host is up (0.12s latency).

PORT     STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp   open   ssh
3306/tcp closed mysql

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.68 seconds
```

SSH port is open. To access the MySQL service, we can either SSH into the server and access MySQL from inside the Ubuntu server, or we can port forward it to our localhost on port `1234` and access it locally. A benefit of accessing it locally is, if we want to execute a remote exploit on the MySQL service, we won't be able to do it without port forwarding. This is due to MySQL being hosted locally on the Ubuntu server on port `3306`. So, we will use the below command to forward our local port (1234) over SSH to the Ubuntu server.
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 ubuntu@10.129.202.64

ubuntu@10.129.202.64's password:

The `-L` command tells the SSH client to request the SSH server to forward all the data we send via the port `1234` to `localhost:3306` on the Ubuntu server. By doing this, we should be able to access the MySQL service locally on port 1234. We can use Netstat or Nmap to query our local host on 1234 port to verify whether the MySQL service was forwarded.
#### Confirming Port Forward with Netstat
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ netstat -antp | grep 1234

(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info

```

#### Confirming Port Forward with Nmap
```c

```

Similarly, if we want to forward multiple ports from the Ubuntu server to your localhost, you can do so by including the `local port:server:port` argument to your ssh command. For example, the below command forwards the apache web server's port 80 to your attack host's local port on `8080`.
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```

#### Setting up to Pivot

Now, if you type `ifconfig` on the Ubuntu host, you will find that this server has multiple NICs:

- One connected to our attack host (`ens192`)
- One communicating to other hosts within a different network (`ens224`)
- The loopback interface (`lo`).

```c
ubuntu@WEB01:~$ ifconfig

```

In our current scenario, we don't know which services lie on the other side of the network. So, we can scan smaller ranges of IPs on the network (`172.16.5.1-200`) network or the entire subnet (`172.16.5.0/23`). We cannot perform this scan directly from our attack host because it does not have routes to the `172.16.5.0/23` network. To do this, we will have to perform `dynamic port forwarding` and `pivot` our network packets via the Ubuntu server. We can do this by starting a `SOCKS listener` on our `local host` (personal attack host or Pwnbox) and then configure SSH to forward that traffic via SSH to the network (172.16.5.0/23) after connecting to the target host.

This is called `SSH tunneling` over `SOCKS proxy`. SOCKS stands for `Socket Secure`, a protocol that helps communicate with servers where you have firewall restrictions in place. Unlike most cases where you would initiate a connection to connect to a service, in the case of SOCKS, the initial traffic is generated by a SOCKS client, which connects to the SOCKS server controlled by the user who wants to access a service on the client-side. Once the connection is established, network traffic can be routed through the SOCKS server on behalf of the connected client.

This technique is often used to circumvent the restrictions put in place by firewalls, and allow an external entity to bypass the firewall and access a service within the firewalled environment. One more benefit of using SOCKS proxy for pivoting and forwarding data is that SOCKS proxies can pivot via creating a route to an external server from `NAT networks`. SOCKS proxies are currently of two types: `SOCKS4` and `SOCKS5`. SOCKS4 doesn't provide any authentication and UDP support, whereas SOCKS5 does provide that. Let's take an example of the below image where we have a NAT'd network of 172.16.5.0/23, which we cannot access directly.

![](https://i.imgur.com/227v1yN.png)

The attack host starts the SSH client and requests the SSH server to allow it to send some TCP data over the ssh socket. The SSH server responds with an acknowledgment, and the SSH client then starts listening on `localhost:9050`. Whatever data you send here will be broadcasted to the entire network (172.16.5.0/23) over SSH. We can use the below command to perform this dynamic port forwarding.

#### Enabling Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```

The `-D` argument requests the SSH server to enable dynamic port forwarding. Once we have this enabled, we will require a tool that can route any tool's packets over the port `9050`. We can do this using the tool `proxychains`, which is capable of redirecting TCP connections through TOR, SOCKS, and HTTP/HTTPS proxy servers and also allows us to chain multiple proxy servers together. Using proxychains, we can hide the IP address of the requesting host as well since the receiving host will only see the IP of the pivot host. Proxychains is often used to force an application's `TCP traffic` to go through hosted proxies like `SOCKS4`/`SOCKS5`, `TOR`, or `HTTP`/`HTTPS` proxies.

To inform proxychains that we must use port 9050, we must modify the proxychains configuration file located at `/etc/proxychains.conf`. We can add `socks4 127.0.0.1 9050` to the last line if it is not already there.
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ tail -4 /etc/proxychains.conf

# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
socks4 	127.0.0.1 9050
```

Now when you start Nmap with proxychains using the below command, it will route all the packets of Nmap to the local port 9050, where our SSH client is listening, which will forward all the packets over SSH to the 172.16.5.0/23 network.
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ proxychains nmap -v -sn 172.16.5.1-200

```

This part of packing all your Nmap data using proxychains and forwarding it to a remote server is called `SOCKS tunneling`. One more important note to remember here is that we can only perform a `full TCP connect scan` over proxychains. The reason for this is that proxychains cannot understand partial packets. If you send partial packets like half connect scans, it will return incorrect results. We also need to make sure we are aware of the fact that `host-alive` checks may not work against Windows targets because the Windows Defender firewall blocks ICMP requests (traditional pings) by default.

The Nmap scan shows several open ports, one of which is `RDP port` (3389). Similar to the Nmap scan, we can also pivot `msfconsole` via proxychains to perform vulnerable RDP scans using Metasploit auxiliary modules. We can start msfconsole with proxychains.

# Questions & Answers

### Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH and SOCKS Tunneling

1. You have successfully captured credentials to an external facing Web Server. Connect to the target and list the network interfaces. How many network interfaces does the target web server have? (Including the loopback interface)

SSH to 10.129.185.233 (ACADEMY-PIVOTING-LINUXPIV) with user "ubuntu" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!"

So this is pretty ease to do, all we need to do, is to ssh to the target with the above credentials and run ifconfig or ip a / all command to list all the network interfaces and simply count them
```c
ssh ubuntu@10.129.185.233
The authenticity of host '10.129.185.233 (10.129.185.233)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:AtNYHXCA7dVpi58LB+uuPe9xvc2lJwA6y7q82kZoBNM.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Enter password: HTB_@cademy_stdnt!

ubuntu@WEB01:~$ ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo

    link/ether 00:50:56:94:5c:d2 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

    inet6 fe80::250:56ff:fe94:5cd2/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

2.  Apply the concepts taught in this section to pivot to the internal network and use RDP (credentials: victor:pass@123) to take control of the Windows target on 172.16.5.19. Submit the contents of Flag.txt located on the Desktop.

I have included the content of this module in this file as understanding the concepts and methods of pivoting and establishing tunneling are clearly written here, so you can scroll up and read it carefully. 

We need to use proxychains and nmap to scan for ports.
```c
proxychains nmap -v -Pn -sT 172.16.5.19
[proxychains] config file found: /etc/proxychains4.conf
[proxychains] preloading /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproxychains.so.4
[proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.17

```

So as the task indicates to apply the concepts taught in this section, we need to use port 9050 to enable dynamic port forwarding with ssh.
We see that 135 RDP port is opened, so we can use rdp with proxychains but first we need to we need to ssh with proxychains port. 
```c
ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.131.83
ubuntu@10.129.131.83's password: 
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-91-generic x86_64)
  System load:             0.0
  Usage of /:              30.4% of 13.72GB
  Memory usage:            31%
  Swap usage:              0%
  Processes:               179
  Users logged in:         0
  IPv4 address for ens192: 10.129.131.83
  IPv6 address for ens192: dead:beef::250:56ff:feb0:2d3c
  IPv4 address for ens224: 172.16.5.129
```

After that we can use proxychains with rdp and the credentials which are provided.
```c
proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123
```

On the desktop you will find the flag.txt file.


### Remote/Reverse Port Forwarding with SSH

3. Which IP address assigned to the Ubuntu server Pivot host allows communication with the Windows server target? (Format: x.x.x.x) 

SSH to 10.129.131.83 (ACADEMY-PIVOTING-LINUXPIV) with user "ubuntu" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!" 

First we need to ssh to target
```c
ssh ubuntu@10.129.131.83  
ubuntu@10.129.131.83's password: 
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-91-generic x86_64)
  System load:             0.0
  Usage of /:              30.4% of 13.72GB
  Memory usage:            31%
  Swap usage:              0%
  Processes:               179
  Users logged in:         1
  IPv4 address for ens192: 10.129.131.83
  IPv6 address for ens192: dead:beef::250:56ff:feb0:2d3c
  IPv4 address for ens224: 172.16.5.129

```

And now the answer will be IP for ens224.

4.  What IP address is used on the attack host to ensure the handler is listening on all IP addresses assigned to the host? (Format: x.x.x.x) 

The IP address `0.0.0.0` is commonly used to indicate that a service (like a handler) should **listen on all available IP addresses** assigned to a host.
