# Pivoting Tunneling, and Port Forwarding

During a `red team engagement`, `penetration test`, or an `Active Directory assessment`, we will often find ourselves in a situation where we might have already compromised the required `credentials`, `ssh keys`, `hashes`, or `access tokens` to move onto another host, but there may be no other host directly reachable from our attack host. In such cases, we may need to use a `pivot host` that we have already compromised to find a way to our next target. One of the most important things to do when landing on a host for the first time is to check our `privilege level`, `network connections`, and potential `VPN or other remote access software`. If a host has more than one network adapter, we can likely use it to move to a different network segment. Pivoting is essentially the idea of `moving to other networks through a compromised host to find more targets on different network segments`.

There are many different terms used to describe a compromised host that we can use to `pivot` to a previously unreachable network segment. Some of the most common are:

- `Pivot Host`
- `Proxy`
- `Foothold`
- `Beach Head system`
- `Jump Host`

Pivoting's primary use is to defeat segmentation (both physically and virtually) to access an isolated network. `Tunneling`, on the other hand, is a subset of pivoting. Tunneling encapsulates network traffic into another protocol and routes traffic through it. Think of it like this:

We have a `key` we need to send to a partner, but we do not want anyone who sees our package to know it is a key. So we get a stuffed animal toy and hide the key inside with instructions about what it does. We then package the toy up and send it to our partner. Anyone who inspects the box will see a simple stuffed toy, not realizing it contains something else. Only our partner will know that the key is hidden inside and will learn how to access and use it once delivered.

Typical applications like VPNs or specialized browsers are just another form of tunneling network traffic.

#### Lateral Movement
Lateral movement can be described as a technique used to further our access to additional `hosts`, `applications`, and `services` within a network environment. Lateral movement can also help us gain access to specific domain resources we may need to elevate our privileges. Lateral Movement often enables privilege escalation across hosts.

#### Pivoting
Utilizing multiple hosts to cross `network` boundaries you would not usually have access to. This is more of a targeted objective. The goal here is to allow us to move deeper into a network by compromising targeted hosts or infrastructure.

#### Tunneling
We often find ourselves using various protocols to shuttle traffic in/out of a network where there is a chance of our traffic being detected. For example, using HTTP to mask our Command & Control traffic from a server we own to the victim host. The key here is obfuscation of our actions to avoid detection for as long as possible. We utilize protocols with enhanced security measures such as HTTPS over TLS or SSH over other transport protocols. These types of actions also enable tactics like the exfiltration of data out of a target network or the delivery of more payloads and instructions into the network.


### Port Forwarding
`Port forwarding` is a technique that allows us to redirect a communication request from one port to another. Port forwarding uses TCP as the primary communication layer to provide interactive communication for the forwarded port. However, different application layer protocols such as SSH or even [SOCKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS) (non-application layer) can be used to encapsulate the forwarded traffic. This can be effective in bypassing firewalls and using existing services on your compromised host to pivot to other networks.
