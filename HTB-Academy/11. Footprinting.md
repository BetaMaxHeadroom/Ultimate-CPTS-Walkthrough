Enumeration -  information gathering using active (scans) and passive (use of third-party providers) methods.
Our goal is not to get at the systems but to find all the ways to get there.
This methodology is nested in 6 layers and represents, metaphorically speaking, boundaries that we try to pass with the enumeration process. The whole enumeration process is divided into three different levels:

| `Infrastructure-based enumeration` | `Host-based enumeration` | `OS-based enumeration` |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |

| **Layer**                | **Description**                                                                                        | **Information Categories**                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1. Internet Presence`   | Identification of internet presence and externally accessible infrastructure.                          | Domains, Subdomains, vHosts, ASN, Netblocks, IP Addresses, Cloud Instances, Security Measures      |
| `2. Gateway`             | Identify the possible security measures to protect the company's external and internal infrastructure. | Firewalls, DMZ, IPS/IDS, EDR, Proxies, NAC, Network Segmentation, VPN, Cloudflare                  |
| `3. Accessible Services` | Identify accessible interfaces and services that are hosted externally or internally.                  | Service Type, Functionality, Configuration, Port, Version, Interface                               |
| `4. Processes`           | Identify the internal processes, sources, and destinations associated with the services.               | PID, Processed Data, Tasks, Source, Destination                                                    |
| `5. Privileges`          | Identification of the internal permissions and privileges to the accessible services.                  | Groups, Users, Permissions, Restrictions, Environment                                              |
| `6. OS Setup`            | Identification of the internal components and systems setup.                                           | OS Type, Patch Level, Network config, OS Environment, Configuration files, sensitive private files |

Layer 1 - The goal of this layer is to identify all possible target systems and interfaces that can be tested.
Layer 2 - The goal is to understand what we are dealing with and what we have to watch out for.
Layer 3 - This layer aims to understand the reason and functionality of the target system and gain the necessary knowledge to communicate with it and exploit it for our purposes effectively.
Layer 4 - The goal here is to understand these factors and identify the dependencies between them.
Layer 5 - It is crucial to identify these and understand what is and is not possible with these privileges.
Layer 6 - The goal here is to see how the administrators manage the systems and what sensitive internal information we can glean from them.

### Infrastructure Based Enumeration
Consists of:  Domain Information, Cloud Resources, Staff

#### Domain Information
- Online presence - SSL certificate, often, such a certificate includes more than just a subdomain, and this means that the certificate is used for several domains, and these are most likely still active. Tool - https://crt.sh/ Gives all subdomains, the certificate information and etc.
- Company hosted services - Tool - https://www.shodan.io/. It searches the Internet for open TCP/IP ports and filters the systems according to specific terms and criteria. For example, open HTTP or HTTPS ports and other server ports for `FTP`, `SSH`, `SNMP`, `Telnet`, `RTSP`, or `SIP` are searched. As a result, we can find devices and systems, such as `surveillance cameras`, `servers`, `smart home systems`, `industrial controllers`, `traffic lights` and `traffic controllers`, and various network components.
