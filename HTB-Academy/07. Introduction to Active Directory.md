# Introduction to Active Directory

Active Directory (AD) is a distributed, hierarchical structure that allows for centralized management of an organization's resources, including users, computers, groups, network devices, file shares, group policies, devices, and trusts. AD provides authentication and authorization functions within a Windows domain environment.

## Active Directory Structure

Active Directory is arranged in a hierarchical tree structure, with a forest at the top containing one or more domains, which can themselves have nested subdomains. A forest is the security boundary within which all objects are under administrative control. A forest may contain multiple domains, and a domain may include further child or sub-domains. A domain is a structure within which contained objects (users, computers, and groups) are accessible. It has many built-in Organizational Units (OUs), such as `Domain Controllers`, `Users`, `Computers`, and new OUs can be created as required. OUs may contain objects and sub-OUs, allowing for the assignment of different group policies.
At a very (simplistic) high level, an AD structure may look as follows:
