# Introduction to Active Directory

Active Directory (AD) is a distributed, hierarchical structure that allows for centralized management of an organization's resources, including users, computers, groups, network devices, file shares, group policies, devices, and trusts. AD provides authentication and authorization functions within a Windows domain environment.

## Active Directory Structure

Active Directory is arranged in a hierarchical tree structure, with a forest at the top containing one or more domains, which can themselves have nested subdomains. A forest is the security boundary within which all objects are under administrative control. A forest may contain multiple domains, and a domain may include further child or sub-domains. A domain is a structure within which contained objects (users, computers, and groups) are accessible. It has many built-in Organizational Units (OUs), such as `Domain Controllers`, `Users`, `Computers`, and new OUs can be created as required. OUs may contain objects and sub-OUs, allowing for the assignment of different group policies.
At a very (simplistic) high level, an AD structure may look as follows:

Here we could say that `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` is the root domain and contains the subdomains (either child or tree root domains) `ADMIN.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`, `CORP.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`, and `DEV.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` as well as the other objects that make up a domain such as users, groups, computers, and more as we will see in detail below. It is common to see multiple domains (or forests) linked together via trust relationships in organizations that perform a lot of acquisitions. It is often quicker and easier to create a trust relationship with another domain/forest than recreate all new users in the current domain.

The graphic below shows two forests, `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` and `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL`. The two-way arrow represents a bidirectional trust between the two forests, meaning that users in `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` can access resources in `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` and vice versa. We can also see multiple child domains under each root domain. In this example, we can see that the root domain trusts each of the child domains, but the child domains in forest A do not necessarily have trusts established with the child domains in forest B. This means that a user that is part of `admin.dev.freightlogistics.local` would NOT be able to authenticate to machines in the `wh.corp.inlanefreight.local` domain by default even though a bidirectional trust exists between the top-level `inlanefreight.local` and `freightlogistics.local` domains. To allow direct communication from `admin.dev.freightlogistics.local` and `wh.corp.inlanefreight.local`, another trust would need to be set up.
