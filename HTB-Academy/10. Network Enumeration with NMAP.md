#### Enumeration - the art, the difficulty, and the goal are not to gain access to our target computer. Instead, it is identifying all of the ways we could attack a target we must find.

Network Mapper (`Nmap`) is an open-source network analysis and security auditing tool written in C, C++, Python, and Lua. It is designed to scan networks and identify which hosts are available on the network using raw packets, and services and applications, including the name and version, where possible.

### Use Cases
The tool is one of the most used tools by network administrators and IT security specialists. It is used to:

Audit the security aspects of networks
Simulate penetration tests
Check firewall and IDS settings and configurations
Types of possible connections
Network mapping
Response analysis
Identify open ports
Vulnerability assessment as well.

### Nmap Architecture
Nmap offers many different types of scans that can be used to obtain various results about our targets. Basically, Nmap can be divided into the following scanning techniques:

Host discovery
Port scanning
Service enumeration and detection
OS detection
Scriptable interaction with the target service (Nmap Scripting Engine)

## Syntax
```
nmap <scan types> <options> <target>
```

There are a total of <span style="color:#00ff73">6 different states</span> for a scanned port we can obtain:

|**State**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`open`|This indicates that the connection to the scanned port has been established. These connections can be **TCP connections**, **UDP datagrams** as well as **SCTP associations**.|
|`closed`|When the port is shown as closed, the TCP protocol indicates that the packet we received back contains an `RST` flag. This scanning method can also be used to determine if our target is alive or not.|
|`filtered`|Nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed because either no response is returned from the target for the port or we get an error code from the target.|
|`unfiltered`|This state of a port only occurs during the **TCP-ACK** scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed.|
|`open\|filtered`|If we do not get a response for a specific port, `Nmap` will set it to that state. This indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port.|
|`closed\|filtered`|This state only occurs in the **IP ID idle** scans and indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered by a firewall.|

## Timing 
- `-T 0` / `-T paranoid`
- `-T 1` / `-T sneaky`
- `-T 2` / `-T polite`
- `-T 3` / `-T normal`
- `-T 4` / `-T aggressive`
- `-T 5` / `-T insane`


When a port is shown as <span style="color:#ffff00">filtered</span>, it can have several reasons. In most cases, <span style="color:#00ff73">firewalls have certain rules set to handle specific connections</span>. The packets can either be `dropped`, or `rejected`. When a packet gets dropped, `Nmap` receives no response from our target, and by default, the retry rate (`--max-retries`) is set to 1. This means `Nmap` will resend the request to the target port to determine if the previous packet was not accidentally mishandled.

<span style="color:#00ff73">Nmap Scripting Engine </span>(`NSE`) is another handy feature of `Nmap`. It provides us with the possibility to create scripts in Lua for interaction with certain services. There are a total of 14 categories into which these scripts can be divided:

|**Category**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`auth`|Determination of authentication credentials.|
|`broadcast`|Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans.|
|`brute`|Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials.|
|`default`|Default scripts executed by using the `-sC` option.|
|`discovery`|Evaluation of accessible services.|
|`dos`|These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services.|
|`exploit`|This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port.|
|`external`|Scripts that use external services for further processing.|
|`fuzzer`|This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time.|
|`intrusive`|Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system.|
|`malware`|Checks if some malware infects the target system.|
|`safe`|Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access.|
|`version`|Extension for service detection.|
|`vuln`|Identification of specific vulnerabilities.|
