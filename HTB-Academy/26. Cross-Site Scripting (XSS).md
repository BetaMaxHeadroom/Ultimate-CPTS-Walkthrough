# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS vulnerabilities take advantage of a flaw in user input sanitization to "write" JavaScript code to the page and execute it on the client side, leading to several types of attacks.
XSS vulnerabilities are solely executed on the client-side and hence do not directly affect the back-end server. They can only affect the user executing the vulnerability. The direct impact of XSS vulnerabilities on the back-end server may be relatively low, but they are very commonly found in web applications, so this equates to a medium risk (`low impact + high probability = medium risk`), which we should always attempt to `reduce` risk by detecting, remediating, and proactively preventing these types of vulnerabilities.

## Types of XSS

There are three main types of XSS vulnerabilities:

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|`Stored (Persistent) XSS`|The most critical type of XSS, which occurs when user input is stored on the back-end database and then displayed upon retrieval (e.g., posts or comments)|
|`Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS`|Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after being processed by the backend server, but without being stored (e.g., search result or error message)|
|`DOM-based XSS`|Another Non-Persistent XSS type that occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is completely processed on the client-side, without reaching the back-end server (e.g., through client-side HTTP parameters or anchor tags)|

<span style="color:#00ff73">Stored XSS or Persistent XSS</span>. If our injected XSS payload gets stored in the back-end database and retrieved upon visiting the page, this means that our XSS attack is persistent and may affect any user that visits the page. Furthermore, Stored XSS may not be easily removable, and the payload may need removing from the back-end database.
