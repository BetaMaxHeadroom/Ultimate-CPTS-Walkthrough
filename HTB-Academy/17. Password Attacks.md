# Password Attacks

 This module will focus on attacking and bypassing the tenet of `Authentication` by compromising user passwords in many different operating systems, applications, and encryption types.
 
 Authentication, at its core, is the validation of your identity by presenting a combination of three main factors to a validation mechanism. They are;

1. Something you know (a password, passcode, pin, etc.).
2. Something you have (an ID Card, security key, or other MFA tools).
3. Something you are (your physical self, username, email address, or other identifiers.)

## Linux

Linux-based systems handle everything in the form of a file. Passwords are also stored encrypted in a file. This file is called the `shadow` file and is located in `/etc/shadow` and is part of the Linux user management system. In addition, these passwords are commonly stored in the form of `hashes`. An example can look like this:
#### Shadow File
```shell-session
root@htb:~# cat /etc/shadow

...SNIP...
htb-student:$y$j9T$3QSBB6CbHEu...SNIP...f8Ms:18955:0:99999:7:::
```

The `/etc/shadow` file has a unique format in which the entries are entered and saved when new users are created.

||||||||||
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|htb-student:|$y $j9T$3QSBB6CbHEu...SNIP...f8Ms:|18955:|0:|99999:|7:|:|:|:|
|`<username>`:|`<encrypted password>`:|`<day of last change>`:|`<min age>`:|`<max age>`:|`<warning period>`:|`<inactivity period>`:|`<expiration date>`:|`<reserved field>`|

The encryption of the password in this file is formatted as follows:

||||
|---|---|---|
|`$ <id>`|`$ <salt>`|`$ <hashed>`|
|`$ y`|`$ j9T`|`$ 3QSBB6CbHEu...SNIP...f8Ms`|

The type (`id`) is the cryptographic hash method used to encrypt the password. Many different cryptographic hash methods were used in the past and are still used by some systems today.

| **ID**   | **Cryptographic Hash Algorithm**                                      |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$1$`    | [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5)                              |
| `$2a$`   | [Blowfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher))           |
| `$5$`    | [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)                        |
| `$6$`    | [SHA-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)                        |
| `$sha1$` | [SHA1crypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1)                      |
| `$y$`    | [Yescrypt](https://github.com/openwall/yescrypt)                      |
| `$gy$`   | [Gost-yescrypt](https://www.openwall.com/lists/yescrypt/2019/06/30/1) |
| `$7$`    | [Scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt)                        |
#### Passwd File

  Credential Storage

```shell-session
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/passwd

...SNIP...
htb-student:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/htb-student:/bin/bash
```

||||||||
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|`htb-student:`|`x:`|`1000:`|`1000:`|`,,,:`|`/home/htb-student:`|`/bin/bash`|
|`<username>:`|`<password>:`|`<uid>:`|`<gid>:`|`<comment>:`|`<home directory>:`|`<cmd executed after logging in>`|

The `x` in the password field indicates that the encrypted password is in the `/etc/shadow` file. However, the redirection to the `/etc/shadow` file does not make the users on the system invulnerable because if the rights of this file are set incorrectly, the file can be manipulated so that the user `root` does not need to type a password to log in. Therefore, an empty field means that we can log in with the username without entering a password.

## Windows Authentication Process

The [Local Security Authority](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/configuring-additional-lsa-protection) (`LSA`) is a protected subsystem that authenticates users and logs them into the local computer. In addition, the LSA maintains information about all aspects of local security on a computer. It also provides various services for translating between names and security IDs (`SIDs`).
![](https://i.imgur.com/AfN47Qy.png)

Local interactive logon is performed by the interaction between the logon process ([WinLogon](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2228450&seqNum=8)), the logon user interface process (`LogonUI`), the `credential providers`, `LSASS`, one or more `authentication packages`, and `SAM` or `Active Directory`. Authentication packages, in this case, are the Dynamic-Link Libraries (`DLLs`) that perform authentication checks. For example, for non-domain joined and interactive logins, the authentication package `Msv1_0.dll` is used.

`Winlogon` is a trusted process responsible for managing security-related user interactions. These include:

- Launching LogonUI to enter passwords at login
    
- Changing passwords
    
- Locking and unlocking the workstation

#### LSASS

[Local Security Authority Subsystem Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Security_Authority_Subsystem_Service) (`LSASS`) is a collection of many modules and has access to all authentication processes that can be found in `%SystemRoot%\System32\Lsass.exe`. This service is responsible for the local system security policy, user authentication, and sending security audit logs to the `Event log`. In other words, it is the vault for Windows-based operating systems.

| **Authentication Packages** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Lsasrv.dll`                | The LSA Server service both enforces security policies and acts as the security package manager for the LSA. The LSA contains the Negotiate function, which selects either the NTLM or Kerberos protocol after determining which protocol is to be successful. |
| `Msv1_0.dll`                | Authentication package for local machine logons that don't require custom authentication.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Samsrv.dll`                | The Security Accounts Manager (SAM) stores local security accounts, enforces locally stored policies, and supports APIs.                                                                                                                                       |
| `Kerberos.dll`              | Security package loaded by the LSA for Kerberos-based authentication on a machine.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Netlogon.dll`              | Network-based logon service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `Ntdsa.dll`                 | This library is used to create new records and folders in the Windows registry.                                                                                                                                                                                |

Each interactive logon session creates a separate instance of the Winlogon service. The [Graphical Identification and Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/gina) (`GINA`) architecture is loaded into the process area used by Winlogon, receives and processes the credentials, and invokes the authentication interfaces via the [LSALogonUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ntsecapi/nf-ntsecapi-lsalogonuser) function.

#### SAM Database

The [Security Account Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc756748(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) (`SAM`) is a database file in Windows operating systems that stores users' passwords. It can be used to authenticate local and remote users. SAM uses cryptographic measures to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing the system. User passwords are stored in a hash format in a registry structure as either an `LM` hash or an `NTLM` hash. This file is located in `%SystemRoot%/system32/config/SAM` and is mounted on HKLM/SAM. SYSTEM level permissions are required to view it.

#### Credential Manager
![](https://i.imgur.com/2yXg7oz.png)

Credential Manager is a feature built-in to all Windows operating systems that allows users to save the credentials they use to access various network resources and websites. Saved credentials are stored based on user profiles in each user's `Credential Locker`. Credentials are encrypted and stored at the following location:
```powershell-session
PS C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\[Vault/Credentials]\
```

#### NTDS

It is very common to come across network environments where Windows systems are joined to a Windows domain. This is common because it makes it easier for admins to manage all the systems owned by their respective organizations (centralized management). In these cases, the Windows systems will send all logon requests to Domain Controllers that belong to the same Active Directory forest. Each Domain Controller hosts a file called `NTDS.dit` that is kept synchronized across all Domain Controllers with the exception of [Read-Only Domain Controllers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/rodc-and-active-directory-schema). NTDS.dit is a database file that stores the data in Active Directory, including but not limited to:

- User accounts (username & password hash)
- Group accounts
- Computer accounts
- Group policy objects

## John The Ripper
John the Ripper (JTR or john) is an essential pentesting tool used to check the strength of passwords and crack encrypted (or hashed) passwords using either brute force or dictionary attacks.

## Cracking Modes

`Single Crack Mode` is one of the most common John modes used when attempting to crack passwords using a single password list. It is a brute-force attack, meaning all passwords on the list are tried, one by one, until the correct one is found. This method is the most basic and straightforward way of cracking passwords and is thus a popular choice for those wishing to gain access to a secure system. It is, however, far from the most efficient method since it can take an indefinite amount of time to crack a password, depending on the length and complexity of the password in question. The basic syntax for the command is:
#### Single Crack Mode
```shell-session
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ john --format=<hash_type> <hash or hash_file>
```

For example, if we have a file named `hashes_to_crack.txt` that contains `SHA-256` hashes, the command to crack them would be:
```shell-session
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ john --format=sha256 hashes_to_crack.txt
```

#### Wordlist Mode

`Wordlist Mode` is used to crack passwords using multiple lists of words. It is a dictionary attack which means it will try all the words in the lists one by one until it finds the right one. It is generally used for cracking multiple password hashes using a wordlist or a combination of wordlists. It is more effective than Single Crack Mode because it utilizes more words but is still relatively basic. The basic syntax for the command is:
```shell-session
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ john --wordlist=<wordlist_file> --rules <hash_file>
```

#### Incremental Mode

`Incremental Mode` is an advanced John mode used to crack passwords using a character set. It is a hybrid attack, which means it will attempt to match the password by trying all possible combinations of characters from the character set. This mode is the most effective yet most time-consuming of all the John modes. This mode works best when we know what the password might be, as it will try all the possible combinations in sequence, starting from the shortest one.
```shell-session
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ john --incremental <hash_file>
```

It is also possible to crack even password-protected or encrypted files with John. We use additional tools that process the given files and produce hashes that John can work with. It automatically detects the formats and tries to crack them. The syntax for this can look like this:
#### Cracking Files with John
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb:~$ <tool> <file_to_crack> > file.hash
cry0l1t3@htb:~$ pdf2john server_doc.pdf > server_doc.hash
cry0l1t3@htb:~$ john server_doc.hash
                # OR
cry0l1t3@htb:~$ john --wordlist=<wordlist.txt> server_doc.hash 
```

Additionally, we can use different modes for this with our personal wordlists and rules. We have created a list that includes many but not all tools that can be used for John:

| **Tool**                | **Description**                               |

## WinRM

[Windows Remote Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal) (`WinRM`) is the Microsoft implementation of the network protocol [Web Services Management Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/ws-management-protocol) (`WS-Management`). It is a network protocol based on XML web services using the [Simple Object Access Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/windows-remote-management-glossary) (`SOAP`) used for remote management of Windows systems. It takes care of the communication between [Web-Based Enterprise Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-Based_Enterprise_Management) (`WBEM`) and the [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-start-page) (`WMI`), which can call the [Distributed Component Object Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dcom/4a893f3d-bd29-48cd-9f43-d9777a4415b0) (`DCOM`).

#### CrackMapExec
A handy tool that we can use for our password attacks.
```shell-session
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec <proto> <target-IP> -u <user or userlist> -p <password or passwordlist>
```

```shell-session
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec winrm 10.129.42.197 -u user.list -p password.list

WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [*] None (name:10.129.42.197) (domain:None)
WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [*] http://10.129.42.197:5985/wsman
WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [+] None\user:password (Pwn3d!)
```

#### Evil-WinRM
Another handy tool that we can use to communicate with the WinRM service:
```shell-session
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ evil-winrm -i <target-IP> -u <username> -p <password>
```

```shell-session
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.42.197 -u user -p password

Evil-WinRM shell v3.3

## SSH

[Secure Shell](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/protocol) (`SSH`) is a more secure way to connect to a remote host to execute system commands or transfer files from a host to a server. The SSH server runs on `TCP port 22` by default, to which we can connect using an SSH client. This service uses three different cryptography operations/methods: `symmetric` encryption, `asymmetric` encryption, and `hashing`.

#### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses the `same key` for encryption and decryption. However, anyone who has access to the key could also access the transmitted data. Therefore, a key exchange procedure is needed for secure symmetric encryption. The [Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) key exchange method is used for this purpose. If a third party obtains the key, it cannot decrypt the messages because the key exchange method is unknown. However, this is used by the server and client to determine the secret key needed to access the data. Many different variants of the symmetrical cipher system can be used, such as AES, Blowfish, 3DES, etc.

#### Asymmetrical Encryption

Asymmetric encryption uses `two SSH keys`: a private key and a public key. The private key must remain secret because only it can decrypt the messages that have been encrypted with the public key. If an attacker obtains the private key, which is often not password protected, he will be able to log in to the system without credentials. Once a connection is established, the server uses the public key for initialization and authentication. If the client can decrypt the message, it has the private key, and the SSH session can begin.

#### Hashing

The hashing method converts the transmitted data into another unique value. SSH uses hashing to confirm the authenticity of messages. This is a mathematical algorithm that only works in one direction.

#### Hydra - SSH

We can use a tool such as `Hydra` to brute force SSH. 
```shell-session
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L user.list -P password.list ssh://10.129.42.197

```

## Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

Microsoft's [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/remote/understanding-remote-desktop-protocol) (`RDP`) is a network protocol that allows remote access to Windows systems via `TCP port 3389` by default. RDP provides both users and administrators/support staff with remote access to Windows hosts within an organization

#### Hydra - RDP

We can also use `Hydra` to perform RDP bruteforcing.
```shell-session
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L user.list -P password.list rdp://10.129.42.197

Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).
