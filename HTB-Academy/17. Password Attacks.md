# Password Attacks

 This module will focus on attacking and bypassing the tenet of `Authentication` by compromising user passwords in many different operating systems, applications, and encryption types.
 
 Authentication, at its core, is the validation of your identity by presenting a combination of three main factors to a validation mechanism. They are;

1. Something you know (a password, passcode, pin, etc.).
2. Something you have (an ID Card, security key, or other MFA tools).
3. Something you are (your physical self, username, email address, or other identifiers.)

## Linux

Linux-based systems handle everything in the form of a file. Passwords are also stored encrypted in a file. This file is called the `shadow` file and is located in `/etc/shadow` and is part of the Linux user management system. In addition, these passwords are commonly stored in the form of `hashes`. An example can look like this:
#### Shadow File
```shell-session
root@htb:~# cat /etc/shadow

...SNIP...
htb-student:$y$j9T$3QSBB6CbHEu...SNIP...f8Ms:18955:0:99999:7:::
```

The `/etc/shadow` file has a unique format in which the entries are entered and saved when new users are created.

||||||||||
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|htb-student:|$y $j9T$3QSBB6CbHEu...SNIP...f8Ms:|18955:|0:|99999:|7:|:|:|:|
|`<username>`:|`<encrypted password>`:|`<day of last change>`:|`<min age>`:|`<max age>`:|`<warning period>`:|`<inactivity period>`:|`<expiration date>`:|`<reserved field>`|

The encryption of the password in this file is formatted as follows:

||||
|---|---|---|
|`$ <id>`|`$ <salt>`|`$ <hashed>`|
|`$ y`|`$ j9T`|`$ 3QSBB6CbHEu...SNIP...f8Ms`|

The type (`id`) is the cryptographic hash method used to encrypt the password. Many different cryptographic hash methods were used in the past and are still used by some systems today.
