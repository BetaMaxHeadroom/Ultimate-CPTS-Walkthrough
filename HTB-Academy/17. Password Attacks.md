# Password Attacks

 This module will focus on attacking and bypassing the tenet of `Authentication` by compromising user passwords in many different operating systems, applications, and encryption types.
 
 Authentication, at its core, is the validation of your identity by presenting a combination of three main factors to a validation mechanism. They are;

1. Something you know (a password, passcode, pin, etc.).
2. Something you have (an ID Card, security key, or other MFA tools).
3. Something you are (your physical self, username, email address, or other identifiers.)
