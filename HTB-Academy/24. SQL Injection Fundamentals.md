Most modern web applications utilize a database structure on the back-end. Such databases are used to store and retrieve data related to the web application, from actual web content to user information and content, and so on. To make the web applications dynamic, the web application has to interact with the database in real-time. As HTTP(S) requests arrive from the user, the web application's back-end will issue queries to the database to build the response. These queries can include information from the HTTP(S) request or other relevant information.

<span style="color:#00ff73">A SQL injection occurs when a malicious user attempts to pass input that changes the final SQL query sent by the web application to the database, enabling the user to perform other unintended SQL queries directly against the database.</span>
SQL injection refers to attacks against relational databases such as `MySQL` (whereas injections against non-relational databases, such as MongoDB, are NoSQL injection).

 We may retrieve secret/sensitive information that should not be visible to us, like user logins and passwords or credit card information, which can then be used for other malicious purposes. SQL injections cause many password and data breaches against websites, which are then re-used to steal user accounts, access other services, or perform other nefarious actions.

A <span style="color:#00ff73">Database Management System (DBMS)</span> helps create, define, host, and manage databases. Various kinds of DBMS were designed over time, such as file-based, Relational DBMS (RDBMS), NoSQL, Graph based, and Key/Value stores.
Some of the essential features of a DBMS include:

|**Feature**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Concurrency`|A real-world application might have multiple users interacting with it simultaneously. A DBMS makes sure that these concurrent interactions succeed without corrupting or losing any data.|
|`Consistency`|With so many concurrent interactions, the DBMS needs to ensure that the data remains consistent and valid throughout the database.|
|`Security`|DBMS provides fine-grained security controls through user authentication and permissions. This will prevent unauthorized viewing or editing of sensitive data.|
|`Reliability`|It is easy to backup databases and rolls them back to a previous state in case of data loss or a breach.|
|`Structured Query Language`|SQL simplifies user interaction with the database with an intuitive syntax supporting various operations.|

Databases can be relational and non-relational. Only Relational Databases utilize SQL, while Non-Relational databases utilize a variety of methods for communications.

<span style="color:#00ff73">A relational database</span> uses a schema, a template, to dictate the data structure stored in the database.
For example, we can have a `users` table in a relational database containing columns like `id`, `username`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and others. The `id` can be used as the table key. Another table, `posts`, may contain posts made by all users, with columns like `id`, `user_id`, `date`, `content`, and so on.
(The relationship between tables within a database is called a Schema.)

<span style="color:#00ff73">A non-relational database</span> (also called a `NoSQL` database) does not use tables, rows, and columns or prime keys, relationships, or schemas. Instead, a NoSQL database stores data using various storage models, depending on the type of data stored.
There are four common storage models for NoSQL databases:
- Key-Value
- Document-Based
- Wide-Column
- Graph

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**General**||
|`mysql -u root -h docker.hackthebox.eu -P 3306 -p`|login to mysql database|
|`SHOW DATABASES`|List available databases|
|`USE users`|Switch to database|
|**Tables**||
|`CREATE TABLE logins (id INT, ...)`|Add a new table|
|`SHOW TABLES`|List available tables in current database|
|`DESCRIBE logins`|Show table properties and columns|
|`INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value_1,..)`|Add values to table|
|`INSERT INTO table_name(column2, ...) VALUES (column2_value, ..)`|Add values to specific columns in a table|
|`UPDATE table_name SET column1=newvalue1, ... WHERE <condition>`|Update table values|
|**Columns**||
|`SELECT * FROM table_name`|Show all columns in a table|
|`SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name`|Show specific columns in a table|
|`DROP TABLE logins`|Delete a table|
|`ALTER TABLE logins ADD newColumn INT`|Add new column|
|`ALTER TABLE logins RENAME COLUMN newColumn TO oldColumn`|Rename column|
|`ALTER TABLE logins MODIFY oldColumn DATE`|Change column datatype|
|`ALTER TABLE logins DROP oldColumn`|Delete column|
|**Output**||
|`SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY column_1`|Sort by column|
|`SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY column_1 DESC`|Sort by column in descending order|
|`SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY column_1 DESC, id ASC`|Sort by two-columns|
|`SELECT * FROM logins LIMIT 2`|Only show first two results|
|`SELECT * FROM logins LIMIT 1, 2`|Only show first two results starting from index 2|
|`SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE <condition>`|List results that meet a condition|
|`SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username LIKE 'admin%'`|List results where the name is similar to a given string|

## MySQL Operator Precedence

- Division (`/`), Multiplication (`*`), and Modulus (`%`)
- Addition (`+`) and Subtraction (`-`)
- Comparison ( =, >, <, <=, >=, !=, LIKE)
- NOT (`!`)
- AND (`&&`)
- OR (`||`)

# **Questions & Answers
1. Connect to the database using the MySQL client from the command line. Use the 'show databases;' command to list databases in the DBMS. What is the name of the first database?
```
mysql -u root -h docker.hackthebox.eu -P 3306 -ppassword
```

2. What is the department number for the 'Development' department?
```
mysql -u root -h docker.hackthebox.eu -P 3306 -ppassword  
SHOW DATABASES;
USE dbname;
```
