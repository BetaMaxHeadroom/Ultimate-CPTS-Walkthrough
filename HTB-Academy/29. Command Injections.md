# Command Injections

It allows us to execute system commands directly on the back-end hosting server, which could lead to compromising the entire network. If a web application uses user-controlled input to execute a system command on the back-end server to retrieve and return specific output, we may be able to inject a malicious payload to subvert the intended command and execute our commands.

Injection vulnerabilities are considered the number 3 risk in [OWASP's Top 10 Web App Risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), given their high impact and how common they are. Injection occurs when user-controlled input is misinterpreted as part of the web query or code being executed, which may lead to subverting the intended outcome of the query to a different outcome that is useful to the attacker.

There are many types of injections found in web applications, depending on the type of web query being executed. The following are some of the most common types of injections:

| Injection                           | Description                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OS Command Injection                | Occurs when user input is directly used as part of an OS command.         |
| Code Injection                      | Occurs when user input is directly within a function that evaluates code. |
| SQL Injections                      | Occurs when user input is directly used as part of an SQL query.          |
| Cross-Site Scripting/HTML Injection | Occurs when exact user input is displayed on a web page.                  |
There are many other types of injections other than the above, like `LDAP injection`, `NoSQL Injection`, `HTTP Header Injection`, `XPath Injection`, `IMAP Injection`, `ORM Injection`, and others. Whenever user input is used within a query without being properly sanitized, it may be possible to escape the boundaries of the user input string to the parent query and manipulate it to change its intended purpose. This is why as more web technologies are introduced to web applications, we will see new types of injections introduced to web applications.

For example, a web application written in `PHP` may use the `exec`, `system`, `shell_exec`, `passthru`, or `popen` functions to execute commands directly on the back-end server, each having a slightly different use case. The following code is an example of PHP code that is vulnerable to command injections:

Code: php

```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['filename'])) {
    system("touch /tmp/" . $_GET['filename'] . ".pdf");
}
?>
```

# Questions & Answers
### Detection
1.  Try adding any of the injection operators after the ip in IP field. What did the error message say (in English)?

So we can try to insert some symbol like ; in the end of the IP address and get the message: 
"Please match the requested format" which is answer

### Injecting Commands
2. Review the HTML source code of the page to find where the front-end input validation is happening. On which line number is it?

Ctrl + U to view the source code and find line:
```
<input type="text" name="ip" placeholder="127.0.0.1" pattern="^((\d{1,2}|1\d\d|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])\.){3}(\d{1,2}|1\d\d|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])$">
