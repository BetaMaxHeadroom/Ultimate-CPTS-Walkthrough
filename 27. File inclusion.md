# Intro to File Inclusions

Many modern back-end languages, such as `PHP`, `Javascript`, or `Java`, use HTTP parameters to specify what is shown on the web page, which allows for building dynamic web pages, reduces the script's overall size, and simplifies the code. In such cases, parameters are used to specify which resource is shown on the page. If such functionalities are not securely coded, an attacker may manipulate these parameters to display the content of any local file on the hosting server, leading to a [Local File Inclusion (LFI)](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/11.1-Testing_for_Local_File_Inclusion) vulnerability.


## Local File Inclusion (LFI)

The most common place we usually find LFI within is templating engines. In order to have most of the web application looking the same when navigating between pages, a templating engine displays a page that shows the common static parts, such as the `header`, `navigation bar`, and `footer`, and then dynamically loads other content that changes between pages. Otherwise, every page on the server would need to be modified when changes are made to any of the static parts. This is why we often see a parameter like `/index.php?page=about`, where `index.php` sets static content (e.g. header/footer), and then only pulls the dynamic content specified in the parameter, which in this case may be read from a file called `about.php`. As we have control over the `about` portion of the request, it may be possible to have the web application grab other files and display them on the page.
